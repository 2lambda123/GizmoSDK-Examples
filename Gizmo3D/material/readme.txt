The example illustrates how material and ligths works and how they influence each other.

It is possible to change the properties of both material and light. 
Use the keys to interact with the scene. 

	c changes the component that are changed

	e increases red component
	r increases green component
	t increases blue component
	y increases alpha component

	d decreases red component
	f decreases green component
	g decreases blue component
	h decreases alpha component

red component in ambient material reflects the red ambient light
red component in specular material reflects the red specular light etc.
