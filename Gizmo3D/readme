General requirements
--------------------

Linux:

The Gizmo3D package requires at least MESA 3.0 libMesaGL.so
or any equivalent implementation of OpenGL libGL.so.

The Mesa libs should preferably be built with Multithread support and shared
libs.

Irix:

The Gizmo3D package support both N32 and O32 models. However yoy should contact
ToolTech Software at sales@tooltech-software.com to get the O32 distribution

Win32:

The Gizmo3D package is today build by MS Visual C++ 6 or 7 but it works with
earlier versions as well.

The Debug version is build with Release libs of libC etc so you must look at
the makefile.mak to get it properly set up

Please note that the examples are shared between many systems and therefor the
formatting of carriage-return and linefeed might get mixed.

You should also note that the makefiles "Makefile" in each directory are for unix
users. WIN32 users should use the command "nmake -f xxxx.mak" where xxx.mak is the
Win32 makefile located in each example directory

Building examples
-----------------

Firs you need to setup your target environment. On Win32 platforms you use the XXX.mak file or the .dsw/.dsp projects.

On unix systems you need to do a "make zzz" where zzz is your preferred platform (irix,linux,mac)

Then you should setupo your system for debug or release builds. Do a "make zzz" where zzz is debug or release.

ex.

> make mac
> make debug
> make

This will build your example...


To clean you example you can use "make clean" or "make cleanall" where muliple targets are compiled
